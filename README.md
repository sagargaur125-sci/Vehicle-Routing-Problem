# Vehicle-Routing-Problem
cvrp_by_me contains code to solve vehicle routing problem classically.
Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is considered to be one of the industrially significant optimization
problems. The VRP is initially formulated as a graph problem. The graph is then optimized for
minimal cost path which represents cost-effective route to be taken. In this paper, both classical and
quantum computing approaches for solving the VRP are discussed. Classical methods is based on
CPLEX optimizer while quantum method is based on the so called variational quantum eigen solver
(VQE). The technical details, code are presented in a detailed manner. The optimal paths as
suggested by both classical and quantum approaches are visualized. The optimal path and the
associated cost obtained using VQE is compared with the classical approach. The obtained values
are comparable ensuring the validity of the quantum approach. Therefore, in this work a simple
demonstration of solving VRP using quantum approach is performed
